This repository contains a collection of Android projects that I have developed using the Kotlin and Java programming languages. Every project is an opportunity to demonstrate my mobile development skills and knowledge, and I'm always looking for ways to improve and learn more.

The repository includes a variety of projects, from basic applications to more complex projects that show my ability to implement different functionalities that android offers.

This repository contains a collection of Android projects that I have developed using the programming languages Kotlin and Java. Each project is an opportunity to demonstrate my skills and knowledge in mobile development, and I am always looking for ways to improve and learn more.

The repository includes a variety of projects, from basic apps to more complex projects that showcase my ability to implement advanced features and work with online services and external devices. All projects are written in Kotlin and Java and full source code is provided for users to see how the various features have been implemented.

This repository is a showcase of my experience and knowledge in developing Android applications and I hope it will be useful for those looking to learn more about this platform. I hope you enjoy exploring my projects and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions!
